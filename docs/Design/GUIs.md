**kivy**
	- looks very sleek, took inspiration from game development
	- 2d and 3d??
	- best GUI for mobile
	- beginner friendly, but has special syntax
	- not that much resources and documentation
**pyqt5**
	- large framework also used in many other languages
	- can also look nice
	- drag and drop interface (that we can use to design without coding)
	- youtube woman said this one is the hardest because it is just so extensive, many features, functions are harder to memorize
	- *NOT FREE?? unless our own application is open source*
	- good tutorials but documentation is a bit meh (C++)
**Tkinter**
	- python's standard GUI library
	- very simple, which means easy to learn, but also has drawbacks
	- a lot of resources
**WxPython**
	- doesn't look so great in the examples i looked up
	- easy to learn
**pygui**
	- very lightweight
