    - Document written code
- **Robin**: 
    - Implementation of adding routines
    - Display of routines (PyQT5 list items) with Achere
    - Connect scheduling algorithm functionality to UI after algorithm is done. This includes displaying the made schedule.

## Stretch Goals / Future Goals
- Restructuring the menu on the left of the main window so that it has a more natural flow, *suggested:* schedule, google, routines, tasks.
- Adding an image on a screen that shows how the program is supposed to be used. Probably on the empty 'Schedule' screen.
- Making categories work as intended.

## General Notes
- Report was quite good; the parts on the programming of the software was a little
too in depth, however it does not have to be changed. New parts should be less
extensive.
- Merge Requests need more extensive comments

- **Robin**:
    - Add preferred hours to the `task_creation_gui.py` with double slider.
    - Work on implementation of overlap resolver
- **Achere**:
    - Work on GUI OAuth integration with Hashim
