# Meeting Notes | 2021-09-27 | Week 4 
*By T. Vercoelen*

## Sprint Planning
This week we aim to connect the google agenda and implement a first version of the GUI.


### Back End
- Teus will finish the code for importing events from the google calendar before wednesday.
- Work on the sorting algorithm can also be started this week. A seperate python file will be made for this.

### Front End
- Robin will merge the code for the task class and task creation before this wednesday.
- Achere has started work on the main python file. The main file will open the main window. From this window the event and task classes will be called and the functions will be coordinated.
- Tabs will be implemented in the GUI. 

### General
- Sessions within tasks have been simplified. They now have the same duration.
- Decisions will be made on how to test the program. The GUI will be tested manually with proof by means of screen recording. The majority of testing will happen at the back end.
