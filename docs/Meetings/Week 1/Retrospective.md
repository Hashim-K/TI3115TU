Week 1 sprint review

We formed our group.
We set up our GitLab, and a Whatsapp group and Discord server for communication.
We brainstormed ideas for our project and decided on **scheduling software**.
We had a meeting with our TA to discuss what we're going to do.
We wrote the **requirements**.
We did research and prepared for the project, for example exploring how to pull and commit to GitLab and thinking of what the algorithm would look like and which data structures we would need, but not concretely yet.
We planned who would be scrum master and notary for the next weeks.
