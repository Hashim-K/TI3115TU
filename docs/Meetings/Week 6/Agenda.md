# Agenda 2021-10-11

 - [ ] Did all the merges go well this weekend?
 - [ ] Were changes made to 'Schedule'? If so, what were the changes? And is it ready to be integrated in the GUI now?
 ### sprint planning
 - [ ] Goal would be for the scheduling algorithm to be finished this week. Is that feasible?
 - [ ] Continue testing
	 - First keep doing unit tests
	 - Start manual testing
 - [ ] Is the back-end done now, except for the algorithm, or are there more things that we will do on the back-end?
	 - Or will back-end people move to front-end?

Work on the 'set up' GUI will probably still take the whole week, but if an additional person starts working on front-end we will think of what they can do. Or if it seems that on Wednesday the people on working on front-end have (almost) finished their tasks, then we can discuss what they will do next during that meeting.
