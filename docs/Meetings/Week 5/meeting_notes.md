## Sprint planning

 - **Report** writing
	- Deadline for the draft is Friday this week
	- Most important thing we need is documentation on the **software architecture** (the GUI, the schedule set up, tasks, the scheduling algorithm)
	- We divided parts such that everyone writes about the parts they coded themself and one person writes about the requirements engineering. The other parts of the report we decided to work on after these were done.
- We want to start doing more **testing**, but decided to leave that for the latter half of the week
