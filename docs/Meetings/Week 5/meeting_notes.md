## Sprint planning

 - **Report** writing
	- Deadline for the draft is Friday this week
	- Most important thing we need is documentation on the **software architecture** (the GUI, the schedule set up, tasks, the scheduling algorithm)
	- We divided parts such that everyone writes about the parts they coded themself and one person writes about the requirements engineering. The other parts of the report we decided to work on after these were done.
- We want to start doing more **testing**, but decided to leave that for the latter half of the week


6-10-2021
TA meeting
- give a recap of what we're doing
- we can still write more comments on **merge requests**
- expectation "minimal working product", we don't have that yet, but we have already developed other things needed to make the algorithm
- manual test for GUI, can write it in the report as a table: write what you did, what you expected, and what the result was
- use test folder
- ask head TA about pipeline import error

our meeting
- Teus' code could be tested
- google authorize problem, socket does not close on exit
