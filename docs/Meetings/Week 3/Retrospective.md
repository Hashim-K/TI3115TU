# Week 3 sprint retrospective

## What went well?:
- A good amount of programming was done.
- Team communication about what had to be done was well; meetings were frequent (each working day except tuesday) and insightful.

## What didn't go well?
- Implementing OAuth took more time than expected. This made us move its deadline a week further.
- Miscommunication between us and the TA; we expected changes to the PyLint pipeline as to not give us errors on imports of modules and style but got a response to go through the errors. We did not state the problem clearly; this should be done in the next TA meeting.

## Week Goals
### Back End
- JSON import and Task Class are implemented.
- OAuth import still needs to be fully fleshed out.

### Front End
- Design goals were reached. Programming has been done on the landing window, main window and task-creation window.
- We require documentation on how we will implement the way the GUI and the logic will work together once we implement GUI corresponding to certain parts of logic created by the back-end team.
