## Sprint planning

**Back end**

 - This sprint, the back end team will decide on the structure of the schedule class and those decisions will be shared with the front end team by sharing the files and by communication with the flex
 - By Wednesday json import and export will be implemented by Hashim and Nina
 - By Wednesday Teus will implement the processing of the information from google calendar to json, OAuth code is shared in google docs by Achere
 - Getters and setters for the task class will be made by Nina this week
 - The goal is to have a prototype product by the end of the week, which imports and processes the google calendar with oauth sign in, and has working classes

**Front end**

 - User interface designs will be made before Wednesday page by page
 - Inventorize all the parts needed for the gui
 - By the end of the week it will be clear what everything will look like and how everything fits together

**General**

 - The final name of the programme will be 25/8, pronounced twentyfive eight
 - Flex will be focusing more on the back end this sprint

## This sprint plan (week 3)

 - First prototype of software with a working connection to google calendar
 - Finalised design of the graphic user interface

## TA meeting

 - The requirements needed some small improvements, which we handled immediately afterwards during our group meeting
 - We might want to start thinking about how to test our code and already start testing small parts of code, since testing your code can turn out to be rather hard later on
 - Creating a developmental branch in our gitlab, to protect our main branch might be an option

## Group meeting

 **Task class elaboration**
 

 - TaskID will be automatically generated by the programme
 - The gui will handle name and description by setting a maximum number of characters
 - We will get rid of the total duration attribute
 - tasks can have the same priority
 - 0 is no priority, 1 is highest priority and 10 is lowest priority
 - The algorithm will first handle the tasks with highest priority and then move on to the tasks with the next priority
 - Deadline will be passed as a daytime object by the gui
 - The attribute repeatable will be passed as a boolean
 - Category will be an integer, which will be translated by definition to a category name
 - Categories can be created by the user and will be stored in a json file with their corresponding colour and name
 - Category will not have a high priority right now
 - Preferred time will have 3/4 options: morning, afternoon, evening, (night)
 - The user will determine how many sessions a task should have and how long each session will take place
 - Teus made a code to translate time to integer values


**General**

 - Users should also be able to use our software without a google calendar
 - We have to create a main python file, which will most likely run the gui
 - OAuth needs to be fixed and optimized
 - We need to decide on a way to store our google calendar and regular tasks

## Next group meeting plan

 - Create a main python file
 - Decide on the data structure of all our different task cases 
 - Fix OAuth
